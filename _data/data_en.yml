  summary: |
    As a mathematics student, I have developed an abstract way of thinking, as well as a way to approach and face different problems from different perspectives using various tools. Furthermore, my computer science knowledge is becoming increasingly advanced, with expertise in high-level languages such as Java, Python, C, C++, R, HTML, JS, and CSS. The fact that I have used so many languages strengthens me as a programmer, facilitating the learning of other languages and skills.
